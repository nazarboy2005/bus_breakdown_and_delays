# 🚍 NYC Bus Transportation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **bus transportation data** from the **New York Division of Transportation** to identify key patterns in **delays and breakdowns**. The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve the efficiency and reliability of the city's bus system.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple sheets, each containing different aspects of the analysis:

- **Scenario** – Project description and problem statement.
- **Bus_Breakdown_and_Delays_NYC** – Raw data containing details of bus delays and breakdowns.
- **CLEANED DATA** – Processed and structured version of the dataset for analysis.
- **Question 1** – Analysis of common reasons for delays and breakdowns.
- **Question 2** – Analysis of delay times across bus companies and boroughs.
- **Question 3** – Correlation between days of the week and frequency of delays/breakdowns.

## 🔎 Key Insights
### **1️⃣ What are the most common reasons for delays and breakdowns?**
- 🚦 **Heavy Traffic** accounted for **62%** of total delays causes.
- 🔧 **Mechanical Problems** were the leading cause of breakdowns (**10,399 incidents recorded**).
